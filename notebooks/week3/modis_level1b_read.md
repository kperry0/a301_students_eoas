# Reading modis level1b data

## Background

```{code-cell}
import pprint
from pathlib import Path

import a301_lib
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from pyhdf.SD import SD
from pyhdf.SD import SDC
```

## get all files from the data_dir that end in hdf

the `PosixPath` object is the way that python is able to treat all folder paths the same, whether they look like `C:\Users\phil` or `/Users/home/phil`

There is only 1 hdf file in `sat_data`, so the cell below returns a list of length 1

```{code-cell}
print(a301_lib.sat_data)
```

```{code-cell}
hdf4_dir = a301_lib.sat_data / 'hdf4_files'
all_files = list(hdf4_dir.glob("*MYD02*2105*hdf"))
print(all_files)
```

Now read that file (converting PosixPath into a string since the pyhdf library is
expecting a string).  Use the `.info` method to get the number of datasets and attributes

```{code-cell}
file_name = str(all_files[0])
print(f"reading {file_name}")
the_file = SD(file_name, SDC.READ)
stars = "*" * 50
print(
    (
        f"\n{stars}\n"
        f"number of datasets, number of attributes\n"
        f"={the_file.info()}\n"
        f"{stars}\n"
        f"\nHere is the help file for the info funtion:\n"
    )
)
#help(SD.info)
```

## Find the dataset and print their indices

We know we've got 31 datasets in the file -- what are their names?

```{code-cell}
datasets_dict = the_file.datasets()

for idx, sds in enumerate(datasets_dict.keys()):
    print(idx, sds)

#breakpoint()
```

 ## open one of the datasets (number 4, EV_1KM_Emissive) and get its shape and data type
 
 The "Earth View Emissive" dataset contains all the longwave channels, and all the 2030 rows and 1354 columns for each
 pixel in each channel

```{code-cell}
longwave_data = the_file.select("EV_1KM_Emissive")  # select sds
print(longwave_data.info())
```

## Get the first row of the first channel and find its numpy dtype

uint16 is "unsigned 16 bit integer", which is how the modis raw counts are stored.  By using
2 8-bit words (2 bytes) for each measurement they can represent (2**16)-1 = 65535 radiance values.  This means, however that every measurement has to be converted from uin16 to float32 before it
can be used

```{code-cell}
data_row = longwave_data[0, 0, :]  # get sds data
print(data_row.shape, data_row.dtype)
```

## get all the rows and columns for the first channel

```{code-cell}
longwave_data[0, :, :]
```

## Find the attributes for EV_1KM_Emissive

In order to make the conversion from int to float, we need to
multiply by a scale factor and subtract an offset.  These are
stored as attributes in the hdf file, and they are different
for each of the 16 channels.  Use `pprint` to pretty-print the big
dictionary.

```{code-cell}
pprint.pprint(longwave_data.attributes())
```

## Print the first 1000 characters of the Metadata.0 string

Date, orbit number, etc. are stored in a long string attribute called 'StructMetadata.0'.
The \t character is a tab stop so the file is easier to read with an editor.

```{code-cell}
pprint.pprint(the_file.attributes()["StructMetadata.0"][:1000])
```

## Now plot the data using imshow

Start over again and make a plot.  We need to be
able to identify particular bands  -- the channel numbers
are stored in the "Band_1KM_Emissive" dataset

```{code-cell}
longwave_bands = the_file.select("Band_1KM_Emissive")
```

```{code-cell}
longwave_bands.info()
```

```{code-cell}
band_nums = longwave_bands.get()
print(f"here are the modis channels in the emissive dataset \n{band_nums}")
```

Note that only channels 20 to 36 are in the Emissive dataset (see [the Modis channel listing](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/specifications.php))

## find the index for channel 30

Count the items in the vector above and convince yourself that channel 30 is index 9, starting from 0

But there's a better way: use numpy.searchsorted to find the index with the closest value
to 30:

We also need to turn that index (type int64) into a plain python int so it can be used to specify the channel

```{code-cell}
ch30_index = np.searchsorted(band_nums, 30.0)
print(f"make sure our index datatime in int64: {ch30_index.dtype}")
ch30_index = int(ch30_index)
print(f"channel 30 is located at index {ch30_index}")


# ## Read channel 30 at index 9 into a numpy array of type uint16
```

## Now get the data for channel 30

```{code-cell}
ch30_data = longwave_data[ch30_index, :, :]
print(ch30_data.shape)
print(ch30_data.dtype)
#breakpoint()
```

Plot the channel 30 image

Use [imshow with a colorbar](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/color/colorbar_basics.html#sphx-glr-gallery-color-colorbar-basics-py)

```{code-cell}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 14))
CS = ax.imshow(ch30_data)
cax = fig.colorbar(CS)
ax.set_title("uncalibrated counts")
#
# add a label to the colorbar and flip it around 270 degrees
# (just my personal preference for labels)
#
out = cax.ax.set_ylabel("Chan 30 raw counts")
out.set_verticalalignment("bottom")
out.set_rotation(270)
print(ch30_data.shape)
```

## Now convert the raw counts to radiances

We need to find the right scale and offset for channel 30

+++

To turn the raw counts into pixel radiances, you need to apply equation 5.8 on p. 36 of the
[modis users guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ckd3dv4n7nxc9p0/modis_users_guide.pdf?dl=0):

$Radiances = (RawData - offset) \times scale$

We have just read the RawData,  the offset and the scale are stored in two vectors that are attributes of the Emissive dataset.  We'll make a version of the figure above, but plot Channel 30 radiance (in W/m^2/micron/sr), rather than raw counts.

```{code-cell}
scales = longwave_data.attributes()["radiance_scales"]
offsets = longwave_data.attributes()["radiance_offsets"]
ch30_scale = scales[ch30_index]
ch30_offset = offsets[ch30_index]
print(f"scale: {ch30_scale}, offset: {ch30_offset}")
```

```{code-cell}
ch30_calibrated = (ch30_data - ch30_offset) * ch30_scale
```

## Plot the Channel 30 radiances

Do these look right?  How would you tell?

```{code-cell}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 14))
CS = ax.imshow(ch30_calibrated)
cax = fig.colorbar(CS)
ax.set_title("Channel 30 radiance")
#
# add a label to the colorbar and flip it around 270 degrees
#
out = cax.ax.set_ylabel("Chan radiance $(W\,m^{-2}\,\mu m^{-1}\,sr^{-1})$")
out.set_verticalalignment("bottom")
out.set_rotation(270)
ch30_calibrated.shape
#
# close the file
#
the_file.end()
```

## Write the radiances out for safekeeping

Follow the example here: https://hdfeos.org/software/pyhdf.php

```{code-cell}
# Create an HDF file
outname = "ch30_out.hdf"
sd = SD(outname, SDC.CREATE | SDC.WRITE | SDC.TRUNC)

# Create a dataset
sds = sd.create("ch30", SDC.FLOAT64, ch30_calibrated.shape)

# Fill the dataset with a fill value
sds.setfillvalue(0)

# Set dimension names
dim1 = sds.dim(0)
dim1.setname("row")
dim2 = sds.dim(1)
dim2.setname("col")

# Assign an attribute to the dataset
sds.units = "W/m^2/micron/sr"

# Write data
sds[:, :] = ch30_calibrated

# Close the dataset
sds.endaccess()

# Flush and close the HDF file
sd.end()
```

Did this work?  See if the file exists:

```{code-cell}
hdf_files = list(Path().glob("*hdf"))
print(hdf_files)
```

## move all of this into a function

```{code-cell}
file_name = str(all_files[0])
print(f"reading {file_name}")
the_file = SD(file_name, SDC.READ)
the_band=30

def readband(the_file,the_band):

    thechan_index = int(np.searchsorted(band_nums, the_band))
    print(thechan_index)
    thechan_data = longwave_data[thechan_index, :, :]
    scales = longwave_data.attributes()["radiance_scales"]
