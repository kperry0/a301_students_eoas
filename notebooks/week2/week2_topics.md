# Week 2

* Review from Week 1

  * Read Stull Chapter 2 through page 38

  * Intro to Jupyter

* Week 2 topics for Monday

   * Review: Sections 4 and 5 of Kazarinoff:  Python REPL and datatypes

   * Introduce: Stull Chapter 2 pages 38-40 on radiative flux

   * For Wednesday: Also read my {ref}`beers_law` notes

   * For Wednesday: Work through Kazarinoff Chapters 6 (Numpy) and 7 (Plotting)

   * Class discussion question: why does python have both tuples and lists?

   * Class discussion question: how do we measure flux?


* Week 2 topics for Wednesday

  * Review Kazarinoff Chapters 6 (Numpy) and 7 (Plotting)

  * Back to {ref}`beers_law`  -- do in-class problems starting at {ref}`week2_probs`

  * Introduce the reading on {ref}`radiance` -- key idea: how does a satellite camera
    actually make the measurement -- it uses a photon counter,
    wavelength filter, shutter timer, telescope.  You need to know the e
    the area of the photon counter, the width of the  wavelength filter,
    the total exposure time of the shutter, and the area of the photon counter to
    turn photon counts into radiance.
  
  * For Friday -- read {ref}`radiance` and skim {ref}`flux_from_radiance`

  * Go over [Kazarinoff Chapter    8](https://atsc_web.eoas.ubc.ca/Functions-and-Modules/Introduction.html#functions-and-modules) on funtions and modules.

* Week 2 topics for Friday

  * Review {ref}`radiance` and skim {ref}`flux_from_radiance`

  * Go over some notebooks:

    * {ref}`sec:debugging`  
    * {ref}`sec:numpy`  
    * {ref}`sec:planck`
