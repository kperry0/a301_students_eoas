# Assign 5b: using Stull eqn. 8.4 to find the outgoing radiance


Complete the function below that calculates the radiance through the top
of a stack of layers given the optical thickness, layer temperature and
surface temperature.  I borrowed code from the weighting_functions notebook, my
answer is 9 lines of code including the return statement

    both surface emission (assuming a black surface at temperature Tsfc)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    Tsfc:  float (Kelvin)
       temperature of the black surface
    
    Temps: numpy vector (Kelvin)
       Layer temperatures with Temps[0] being closest to the surface
       Length is N-1, where N is the number of levels
       
    tau: numpy vector (unitless)
       Level values of the absorption optical thicknesses at this wavelength
       taus[0]=0 is the surface, tau[-1]=tau_tot is the total optical thickness
       lenght is N, the number of levels
       
    the_wavel: float (m)
       wavelength for calc_radiance
       
    Returns
    -------
    
    Radiance: float (W/m^2/m/sr) 
       Radiance from the surface and layers passing through the top level

# Testing your code

Here is a test set of layers that should produce a radiance of 9.045 W/m^2/micron/sr

```{code-cell}
from numpy.testing import assert_almost_equal

Temps = np.asarray([300.0, 280.0, 270.0, 260.0])
taus = np.asarray([0.0, 0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.6])
Tsfc = 305.0
the_wavel = 10.0e-6
out = multi_layer_radiance(Tsfc, Temps, taus, the_wavel)
assert_almost_equal(out * 1.0e-6, 9.045, decimal=3)
