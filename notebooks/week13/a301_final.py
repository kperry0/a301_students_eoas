# # A301 final exam
#
# Due midnight, Friday Dec. 11 -- for part 1: leave a notebook in your home folder with your name and
# the word "final".  For part 2 I'll set up a gradescope assignment for upload.
#
# ## Part 1  (30 points)
#
# 1. Rerun the {ref}`landsat1` notebook with a new date to download a second image with the same landsat
#    WRS path,row as your first.  Choose a different season, so that your NDVI index will
#    change between the two images.
#
# 2. Modify the {ref}`rasterio_3bandsII` notebook to read in the B4, B5 and MTL files from
#    both images.  (To keep things organized, I called my first image `sceneA` and my second
#    image `sceneB` and used those variable names as shortcuts to the full filenames, e.g. sceneA_b5,
#    etc.  I stored everything in a dictionary with the scene names as keys.)
#
# 3. As before, use rasterio.mask to crop to your 600 row x 400 column polygon so that the two cropped images
#    have the same affine_transform and can be compared pixel by pixel.  Calculate the B4 and B5 reflectivities
#    and save those  (I added them to my dictionary).
#
# 4. Calculate the ndvi for both cropped scenes and plot the B4, B5 and ndvi images using imshow with
#    palettes that use vmin and vmax set the appropriate levels. You don't have to bother with adding
#    the colorbars to
#    the individual images if you don't want, but print out your choices for vmin and vmax along with the image.
#    Use `plt.subplots(2,2)` to get a matrix of 4 subplots to save space, and delete
#    the unused fourth axis with fig.delaxis(the_ax)
#
# 5. Plot a histogram of the difference (ndiff = ndviA - ndviB).
#
# 6. Find the row and column with the maximum absolute value of ndiff using the following numpy functions:
#
#          index=np.argmax(ndiff)
#          rowmax, colmax =np.unravel_index(index,ndiff.shape)
#
#    Find and print out the longitude and latitude of this pixel.
#
# 7. Make a map of the ndiff image using cartopy, and locate the maximum ndiff pixel on the map with a red dot.
